# Ride Share Population Map
## Goal
Based on a region, this project aims to determine which areas are conisdered 'hot spots', meaning which are the most populous. This is supposed to help ride share drivers that work for companies such as Uber and Lyft, find the most rides needed and know how to obtain the most money.
## Output
The output is supposed to represent a visual cluster map of the hot spots of a region, based on different color codes. In the future, this can be embedded into the ride share app or as a separate application.
